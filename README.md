# Installations (Phase 2 - Hardware construction)

Step 1: Install necessary dependencies by creating requirements.txt in the code’s folder
a.	Put the following words in the text file
i.	opencv-python
requests
Line-bot-sdk

Step 2: Open the operating system’s terminal
a.	Type the following words in the terminal
i.	pip install -r requirements.txt
Step 3: Install YOLOv3 files and put them in the designated folder
a.	Go to the following website and download the necessary files
i.	https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo 

# Installation (Phase 3 -  Running for the program)
Step 1: Use the codes from Phase 1 and procedures from Phase 2 in order to make the image-recognition system and the notification system work.
Step 2: Run the code via a desired coding environment


# Usage
Given the commending results, it is advised that property owners use this program as a supplementary security. Because of the program’s easy implementation, users can be able to install it on their personal computers, it’s also very easy to install due to PyCharm’s gregarious interface which assists in the installation part. By amalgamating this program into the security system, users install an extra protection into their homes, their properties which can warn them about crimes before it happens.

# Features
If detect knife, send line bot notifs
